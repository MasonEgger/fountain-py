FADE IN:

EXT. PARK - DAY

SARAH sits on a bench, reading a book. The sun shines brightly through the trees.

JOHN approaches from the left, carrying a coffee.

JOHN
(excited)
Sarah! I have **amazing** news!

SARAH
(looking up)
What is it?

JOHN
I just got the job at the theater!

SARAH
(jumping up)
That's *incredible*! I'm so proud of you!

They hug.

SARAH (CONT'D)
We should celebrate. Coffee?

JOHN
(grinning)
Already got mine.

He holds up his cup.

FADE OUT.
